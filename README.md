# Deadlift Predictive Application

This project is a predictive analytics application designed for strength trainingâ€”focusing on the deadlift exercise. 
Using synthetic data and a multi-output neural network built with TensorFlow, the application predicts
several key training parameters:
  
- **Training Category:** Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Master, or Grand Master.
- **End-Cycle Goal:** Predicted deadlift weight (in kg) at the end of the training cycle.
- **Cycle Length:** Recommended duration of the training cycle (in weeks).
- **Periodization Style:** Suggested training periodization (e.g., linear, DUP, or block).
- **Weekly Progression:** Average weight increase (kg/week) over the cycle.

# Acknowlagments 
-** The design and training recommendations are inspired by principles of strength training 
-** and periodization, 
-** as discussed in various strength training literature.
